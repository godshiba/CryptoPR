## What is JeChain?
JeChain is an experimental PoW blockchain with smart contract supports. This might be a good learning material for beginners.

[Unfinished, vauge whitepaper](https://nguyenphuminh.github.io/jechain-whitepaper.pdf).

## Setup and use
First, be sure to have Nodejs installed on your machine.

Next, install all the needed packages:
```
npm install
```

If you haven't had your keys, goto `./utils` and type `node keygen`, it will generate a key pair for you. 

Then, if you want to start a node, open the terminal, configure it first:
```sh
# PORT
PORT=Insert your port here
# Peers to connect when startup
PEERS=Address 1, address 2, address 3
# Set your address
MY_ADDRESS=ws://your.ip.and:port
# Set your private key
PRIVATE_KEY=your key
# Assign "true" if you want to setup a mining node, mining is disabled by default
ENABLE_MINING=true
# Assign "true" if you want to log out smart contracts' messages, this is disabled by default
ENABLE_LOGGING=true

# Start the node
node .
```

The equivalent of this on Windows is `set PORT=Insert your port here`

You can mine a block like this:
```js
mine();
```

You can broadcast a transaction like this:
```js
sendTransaction(yourTransaction);
```

You can request for a chain and chain's info with a handy dandy function called `requestChain`: 
```js
requestChain("An address you trust");
```

If you just want to set up a node that mines continously (like most people would), use `loopMine`:
```js
loopMine(optional_delay_time);
```

You can manually connect to a node using `connect`:
```js
connect("address");
```

Note: All of the functions above are asynchronous functions.

### Initial coin release?
Check `./src/blockchain.js`, have a look at the genesis block, change the receiver address to your public address (because you should be the one who holds all the coins initally). Change the amount of coins if you want, it is set to `100000000000000` by default.

You shouldn't care about the minting address though, it can be anything you want.

### Using it publicly
Just forward port, drop your public IP + the port you forwarded in and you are set! If you don't know how to forward port, just search it up online, I can't really put a link here because each router model has a different way to do port forwarding.

### Host your own blockchain network using JeChain's base
Just host a bootstrap node and a node that mines continously, and then ask people to connect to the bootstrap node, and you have technically had a working blockchain network!

## Smart contracts?
This feature is very new, and is likely going to change in the future, but for now, you can read [this document](./CONTRACT.md) on creating smart contracts using a low-level language that I have created called `jelscript`.

Remember to only use it for experimental purposes, I can not guarantee that this feature will be changed or not in the future.

## Should you use JeChain?
Probably not, surely you can use it now, but wait until 1.0 to have the best experience.

## Upcoming features
* Improved security and performance.
* Sharding.
* EVM?

(Many features are already built, but are not pushed publicly due to testing).

## Using JeChain's code
You can use the code in this project to build a chain on your own, but remember to mention me (and any other main contributors of the project) in the credit, thanks.
